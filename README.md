# SparkSQL
Spark SQL offers the platform to provide a structured data to any dataset regardless its source or form. And once that structured data is formed, it can be queried using tools like Hive, Impala, and other Hadoop data warehouse tools.  In this spark project, we will go through Spark SQL syntax to process the dataset, perform some joins with other supplementary data as well as make the data available for the query using the Spark SQL thrift server. On provision of the data, we will perform some interesting query and other go through some performance tuning technique for Spark SQL.
